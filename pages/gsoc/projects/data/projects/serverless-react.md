# Migrating Serverless React Boilerplate to Serverless Application Repository

## DESCRIPTION
Serverless React Boilerplate (https://github.com/99xt/serverless-react-boilerplate) is a quick starter beginner friendly boilerplate to develop serverless application with AWS Lambda, API Gateway as the backend and ReactJS as the frontend. The boilerplate supports offline development as well. Currently it uses the latest version of Serveless framework to provision and automate infrastructure at AWS. We need to migrate Serverless Framework to Serverless Application Model (SAM) such that it can be hosted at Serverless Application Repository for quick start the whole application from AWS Lambda console itself. All the AWS users will be able to use the boilerplate at a click of a button when getting started with AWS Lambda console.

## Things to do
Convert Serverless Framework Templates to Serverless Application Model Templates
Do the necessary configurations to host it at Serverless Application Repository
Write unit tests for main endpoints of the application
Adding redux for state management at frontend side (optional)

## Requirements
The proposal has to contain a clear concept.
Knowledge in Serverless framework, AWS Serverless Application Model, AWS Lambda and ReactJS.
