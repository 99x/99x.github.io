Internship of a student is a crucial time for both company and the student himself
due to various reasons. Lot of companies want to give the best internship experience
to the student but still fails as they are lacking a full fledge management portalto 
manage students.

Intern management portal frontend was developed using AngularJs and Backend was 
developed using aws services and serverless framework.

This is a web portal that visualize working period and feedback for interns.

Current system supports only a single tenent environment. A student is expected 
to extend the functionality of interns-portal to the next level by adding 
multi-tenency by default.
