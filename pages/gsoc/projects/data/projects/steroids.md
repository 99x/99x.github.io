#### Steroids - A Microservice Framework in TypeScript

##### Description
Steroids Framework enables the developers to write more maintainable, testable, and readable microservices known as Steroids Services using TypeScript. Steroids services can be hosted in environment such as AWS lambda, dockers, or any server instance without any code changes. Therefore this feature enables the developers to choose the best execution environment that meets their performance and functionality goals. This feature also enables the developer to make migration decisions of steroids services (i.e. migrating from AWS Lambda to Docker) even at a later stage of the project.

Steroids allows the developers to write synchronous style code which improves readability and maintainability in their source codes by utilising TypeScript's 'async' and 'await' keywords, and by providing them with necessary components to write Steroids Services.

Steroids not only enables the developers to write synchronous style of microservices, but it also enables the developers to write synchronous style of unit test cases with TypeScript with a syntax similar to C#'s nUnit framework.

Steroids also consists of an IoC (Inversion of Control) container which handles the dependency injection feature of Steroids Services which also enables the developers to write agile code that responds to any requirement change.

Steroids is also extensible which its features can be extended using plug-ins. Plugins can be written to access the database, or storage services (i.e. Amazon S3 or FTP).


##### Things to do
- Create command line tool to manage common functionalities in Steroids.
- Create scaffolders in yeoman to create default Steroids Services and Steroids Microservices.
- Include missing features to Steroids documentation.
- Develop new steroids plugins to support various databases and storage mechanisms.
- Add latest features to the default Steroids boilerplate.

##### Requirements
- Passionate about learning and experimenting with cutting-edge technologies.
- Ability to come up with  creative, innovative, and unique ideas.
- Knowledge in TypeScript, JavaScript, and related Design Patterns, AWS Lambda, Docker, Gulp would be helpful.
