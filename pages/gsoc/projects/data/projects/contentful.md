## Contentful CMS Media Manager

`Contentful CMS Media Manager` is a suggestion to develop cross platform desktop tool for manage media in contentful CMS. At the moment contentful CMS doesnâ€™t have a folder structure to manage media. It would be great if this tool can manage a folder structure in a local computer so that users can easily upload and manage their assets. And it would be great if it can upload set of files with a description as a batch and it would be better if images can be edit before upload. 

### Things to do
- Develop a tool to edit and upload media to the given contentful space.
- Should have an interface to manage a folder structure where users can easily manage their media files.

### Requirements
- The proposal has to contain a clear concept.
