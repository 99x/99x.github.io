When it comes to web development, one of the main problem developers face is testing each feature. Each person who wants to test particular feature will have to clone the feature branch, do all the building and deploying work by himself and test the feature. This waste lot of energy and time. ProjectPR will take off this burden by automatically deploying a temporal test instance so that the tester only have to click on a browser link which will navigate to the web application with the new feature.

Docker will be user heavily to develop the engine which powers the ProjectPR. On top of this engine, we need to implement a Web dashboard where user can do all the configurations. This web app needs to implement multi tenency to make it a service app. 

Student needs to have a good understanding about git workflows, git hooks, Docker and containerizing in general.

All the functionality has to be tested by writing propoer unit/integration tests.
