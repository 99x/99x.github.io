Native development has been overtaken by the web in the present. Browsers like 
Google Chrome gives facilities for developers to access raw hardware with a 
minimal abstraction. This gives lot of freedom for developers to comeup with 
interesting solutions to cater real world needs.

With the latest development with IoT, hardware access over the web will soonly 
become one of the key development aspect. In a situation like this, a user of who
is using particular web aplication must be guarantee that the applications are 
allowed to access certain devices with certail limitations.

In this project we are planning to implement a solution which focuses on 
developing a Certification Authority.

Project can be devided into three main components initially:

* Hardware Emulation and Drivers for emulated hardware for the browser.
* Certificate Authority with command line tool to generate certificates as well as ability to sign binary files with relevant signatures.
* Web drivers and browser extensions which are capable of interacting with emulated hardware

Student can work on any of above components for the coming summer.
