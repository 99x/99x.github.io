##### Deliverables

Currently the initial documentation was published into a markdown file on Github. Indeed, the key idea is to compose a well structured documentation for the project coverting perspectives of developer and also the user. Pre-defined sections of the documentation are,

**Developer guide**

- Introducing the project architecture
- Describing each module and connectivity with external entities
- How to setup development environment
- How to deploy the solution
- Customization guidelines

**User guide**

- Introduction to walk2win platform
- Overview of the user application
- How to sync steps via Google Fit and how to do manual entries
- Leaderboards
- Bonus score system

We will be using [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) on Github Pages for composing the overall documentation.
